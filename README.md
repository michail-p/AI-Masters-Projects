## 📂 Project Details

### 🧠 [Answer Set Programming](Answer%20Set%20Programming/)

**Course:** AI-2 (5DV181) – Logic Programming

Implementation of argumentation semantics using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Includes conflict-free sets, admissible sets, stable extensions, and preferred extensions. Features both declarative ASP encodings and an imperative Python solver for performance comparison.

### 👕 [ML - Fashion Article Classification](ML%20-%20Fashion%20Article%20Classification/)

**Course:** Machine Learning

Classification of fashion items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using:

- Custom k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) implementation
- Dense Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron)
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation

### ♟️ [Othello](Othello/)

**Course:** Artificial Intelligence (5DV243)

A competitive Othello (Reversi) game engine featuring:

- Alpha-Beta pruning with iterative deepening search
- Custom position-weighted heuristic evaluation
- Transposition tables and move ordering optimizations
- Time-controlled search within specified limits

### 🎰 [Spin the Wheel](Spin%20the%20wheel/)

**Course:** Software Engineering / Prototype Development

A full-stack "Spin the Wheel" application with:

- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3.x REST API with OpenAPI documentation
- **Frontend:** Angular 19 SPA with slot machine UI components
- Firebase integration for data persistence

### 📊 [Statistics](Statistics/)

**Course:** Statistics for Engineers

Statistical analysis investigating the impact of structured micro-breaks on workplace productivity. Includes hypothesis testing, paired t-tests, effect size calculations, and data visualization.
